## Outreach

As part of my commitment to dissemination and outreach, I have lectured 315h on Communication Strategies in Spanish, 
Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language and Psycholinguistics of Spanish (UIB) and 
I am contributing to an upcoming book on categories and predication in Spanish.  
I have also participated in numerous outreach activities such as: PINT of Science, 
Desgranando Ciencia, Naukas and 3MT (awarded with second prize in 2018) 
as part of my dedication to conveying bilingualism research findings to the public (children, families, and language policy makers), 
and contributing to diverse national and international outreach projects. More soon!

## Research

My research focuses on cognitive processes involved in language and learning, with a particular interest in how people acquire, process, and use multiple languages.

Here you will soon find:

- Ongoing and completed research projects  
- Collaborations with national and international teams  
- Links to project websites and datasets (when available)  
- Information about funded projects and grants
